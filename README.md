# Snipr-AES-Config-Decryptor
Decrypt encrypted snipr configs

## How to use this?
Well its quite simple really. You can either read the code (theres not much there in the first place) OR just drag n drop the encrypted config onto the exe and it will come out decrypted.

## Why is this code so shit?
Cause this is ONLY ment to be used for snipr configs and not to aes decrypt other shit (such as netguard's managed assembly within the native stub).
ps hi xeno :D
